Alright, here’s a clean and logical build order that keeps momentum and avoids confusion:

---

🧠 Step-by-Step Build Flow

Step 1 — Project Setup

Create your React app (npm create vite@latest expense-tracker --template react or CRA if you prefer).

Install Tailwind and test it with a simple h1 style.

Clean out boilerplate files.

---

Step 2 — Basic Layout

In App.jsx, set up a simple container (max-w-2xl mx-auto p-4) for the whole app.

Add a heading like “Expense Tracker” and a placeholder <ExpenseForm /> and <ExpenseList /> component.

---

Step 3 — Add ExpenseForm

Build a form with fields: amount, category, note, date.

Manage each field with useState.

When submitted, the form should create a new expense object and pass it up (via a prop function) to App.jsx.

---

Step 4 — Handle Expenses in App

In App.jsx, create a state:

const [expenses, setExpenses] = useState([]);

Create a function addExpense(newExpense) that adds to this list.

Pass it down to ExpenseForm as a prop.

---

Step 5 — Build ExpenseList

Accept the expenses array as props.

Map through and render <ExpenseItem /> for each expense.

Add delete functionality using a passed-down onDelete handler.

---

Step 6 — Add Summary Section

Create <Summary /> component that calculates:

const total = expenses.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.amount, 0);

Display total and maybe category totals.

---

Step 7 — Add LocalStorage (Optional but good practice)

In App.jsx:

useEffect(() => {
localStorage.setItem("expenses", JSON.stringify(expenses));
}, [expenses]);

On load, pull from localStorage using another useEffect.

---

Step 8 — Style Everything (Tailwind)

Add spacing, colors, shadows, and rounded corners.

Use grid/flex for responsive layouts.

Make buttons stand out with hover transitions.

---

Step 9 — Filter or Sort (Optional Enhancement)

Add a dropdown to filter by category or sort by date/amount.

Use state to manage current filter and show filtered data.

---

Step 10 — Final Polish

Clean up component naming, props, and code formatting.

Add a minimalist empty state message (“No expenses yet 👀”).
